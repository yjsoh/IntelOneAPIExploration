# matrix_mul sample
matrix_mul is a simple program that multiplies together two large matrices and verifies the results. 
This program is implemented using three ways: 
    1. C++ and SYCL language;
    2. C++ and OpenMP (Linux* only);
    3. C++ and MKL;

## How to Build for DPCPP and SYCL 

### on Linux  
   * Build the program using Make  
    cd matrix_mul &&  
    make all  

   * Run the program  
    make run  

   * Clean the program  
    make clean 

### on Windows
The OpenMP offload target is not supported on Windows yet. 

#### Command Line using MSBuild
   * MSBuild matrix_mul.sln /t:Rebuild /p:Configuration="release"  

#### Command Line using nmake
   Build matrix_mul MKL version
   * nmake -f Makefile.win build_mkl  
   * nmake -f Makefile.win run_mkl  

   Build matrix_mul DPCPP version
   * nmake -f Makefile.win build_dpcpp  
   * nmake -f Makefile.win run_dpcpp  

#### Visual Studio IDE
   * Open Visual Studio 2017     
   * Select Menu "File > Open > Project/Solution", find "matrix_mul" folder and select "matrix_mul.sln" 
   * Select Menu "Project > Build" to build the selected configuration
   * Select Menu "Debug > Start Without Debugging" to run the program

## How to Build for OpenMP

### on Linux  
   * Build the program using Make  
    cd matrix_mul &&  
    make build_omp  

   * Run the program  
    make run_omp  

   * Clean the program  
    make clean

## How to Build for MKL

### on Linux  
   * Build the program using Make  
    cd matrix_mul &&  
    make build_mkl  

   * Run the program  
    make run_mkl  

   * Clean the program  
    make clean
